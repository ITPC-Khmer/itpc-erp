=============================================
Next I created a HelperServiceProvider.php by running the artisan command:

php artisan make:provider HelperServiceProvider

Within the register method I added this snippet

public function register()
{
    foreach (glob(app_path().'/Helpers/*.php') as $filename){
        require_once($filename);
    }
}
lastly register the service provider in your config/app.php in the providers array

'providers' => [
    'App\Providers\HelperServiceProvider',
]
now any file in your Helpers directory is loaded, and ready for use.

composer dumpautoload
